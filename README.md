This is a project for [March Machine Learning Mania 2023 Kaggle competition]( https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/march-machine-learning-mania-2023/)


The file structure in this repository is as follows:
- _data_ directory - This is where we store all the data used in our project, as well as any additional data that was available to us.
- _final_datasets_ directory - This is where we store the tables for man's and women's data after the feature engineering. The data is ready for modeling.
- _presentation_ directory - Inside there is our presentation in two formats.
- _submission_ directory - In this directory we store our best solution and files necessary to determine our final score: 
  -  _MNCAATourneyDetailedResults.csv_ and _MNCAATourneyDetailedResults.csv_- datasets with match outcomes for March Madness tourneys including this year's tourney.
  -  _submission.csv_ - our submision dataset, it's compatible with the expected solution by the competition organisers.
  -  _scoring.ipynb_ - jupyter notebook for calculating our scores.
-  _feature\_engineering.ipynb_ - jupyter notebook with the data preparation and  feature engineering pipeline.
-  _modeling.ipynb_ - jupyter notebook with the XGBoost model and base seed\_diff model
-  _other\_models.ipynb_ - jupyter notebook with other - worse models
